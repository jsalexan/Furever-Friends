    "body": "Introducing Benchley! This magnificent pup is the newest member of our family. We met him just days after he'd been rescued from a abusive puppy mill. It's taken a few weeks to get him back in good health, but we know he'll be thriving soon with a little love. Anyone else have a shih tzu or other small dog? We'd love to start socializing him right away. He's so sweet, but very shy."

    "body": "This is our new rescue, Rabbit! She comes all the way to Seattle from Texas where she was sadly surrendered to a kill shelter. Apparently she used to run with a small pack of Chihuahuas in her old neighborhood, so we'd love to set her up with a similar group. Anyone interested? We're in Seward Park."

    "body": "Look at this face! Has there ever been such a happy looking little, fluffy furball? Just brought him home from Seattle Animal Rescue and he needs a name that matches his fabulousness. (They were calling him 'Ruff' in the shelter, which really doesn't suit him Right?.) Sound off with your ideas in the comments!"
