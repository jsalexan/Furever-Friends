## Description

This application is a social media-style platform for dog lovers. Users can login and create a profile that includes their dog's name, breed, size, hobbies, neighborhood, and photo. They can then post pictures and/or text to share with other site users, who can then comment on the posts. Our goal is to create an online community for dog lovers.
<br>

For this application, we used the following technologies: mySQL, NodeJS, Sequelize, Express, Heroku, Cloudinary, Multer, Nodemon, Insomnia, along with JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and more.
<br><br>
Some of the challenges we faced in creating this app included using Handlebars for the first time, getting the routes right, figuring out how to add comments and photos (something we hadn't done in class), and getting all the pieces working in a cohesive manner.
<br><br>
In the future, we would like to add a scheduling feature to plan meetups. We'd also like to link it in some manner to help find local resources for pets.
